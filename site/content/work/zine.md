## the challenge

Brand content marketing is an untapped opportunity on mobile. The media has seen increasing number of brands that would like to show thought leadership, showcase corporate responsibility efforts, or distribute high quality sponsored content.

Most of quality advertisers (Goldman, Fidelity, Netflix, GE, IBM) are completely underserved by content distribution channels like outbrain, taboola, sharethrough. This is an area where a mobile marketplace can position itself as the go-to solution for high end brands with content that readers actually enjoy.

## ideation

Some goals, requirements and constraints to work within:

- Bring some of the content (images/text/videos) forward to better entice the user to read more
- Defining success: given that there are no standard measurements in this segment, how should we position the format to influence the advertisers' definition of success?

  overview: A concept that came out of primary consumer design research on how people discover and purchase brands/products, Lookbook presents a group of products in their natural setting (a room of furniture, a model wearing clothing items, etc.), and allows individual items to be clicked to explore more within the format.

## challenge

Many brands have aspirational images of their products being used for their catalogs or websites. These images range from showing off a complete outfit to the new features inside the latest car model, or anything in-between. However, little efforts have been made to use these brand collateral differently. 

Inspired by findings from the recent [mCommerce Research](/work/mobile-commerce-research/), the Yieldmo design team saw great potential in utilizing these assets to entice customers to learn more and take action. In other words: How might we leverage these assets to create a "shoppable" experience?

## storyboard

We created several user stories to relive the experience one might go through when shopping on mobile web. The illustration below offers a glimpse of what it looked like. These user stories provided valuable context in designing for such experiences.

## userflow and wireframe 

While the entire product is packed only in a limited space, the user flow can become complicated and trickly. The Lookbook design concept proposes a "two-screen" experience where more detailed information about a certain product may be revealed once user interacts with the first screen. The navigation between screens need to be thoroughly thought out, and it's critical to maintain the "appeal" of such design paradigm without impeding usability.

Wireframe iterations based on feedback from internal reviews and user testing:

## interaction design

Lookbook is a totally immersive mobile experience that quickly takes customers from inspiration to information. Since the format utilizes a single image to showcases multiple separate products or features, the visual cue must be clearly communicated but also subtle enough to avoid generate noises. We decided to employ pulsating hotspots to encourage customers to tap to reveal more details and take further action.

## amazon mechanical turk

The team conducted a [comsumer research](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LookbookMTurkPreview) using Amazon Mechanical Turk to understand a few aspects of the product:

- Hot-spot recognition and usage
- Expected brand favorability and in-store visit intent

The research provided qualitative data to understand consumer behavior on a large scale (259 U.S.-based respondents). It was highly valuable in informing design iterations and a/b testing directions.

</div>


## a/b testing

Combined with the insights from MTurk, the team also run numberous A/B tests to better understand user engagement from a quantativie perspective. The example below illustrates 2 ideas regarding "in-view" interaction.

- Idea 1: Format is coming into view, hotspots are already on there, pulsating. Hotspots continue to pulsate as user continues to scroll.
- Idea 2: Format is coming into view, but there are no hotspots. As user continutes to scroll, the hotspots are intruduced and pulsating.

## future iteration

Since we designed initial Lookbook concepts, there has been validation of this type of experience with [Instagram shoppable ads](http://www.adweek.com/digital/retailers-can-now-make-instagram-posts-much-more-shoppable/) and [Pinterest](https://blog.pinterest.com/en/search-outside-box-new-pinterest-visual-discovery-tools), so it is worth developing further iterations that is distinct in Yieldmo's design language.

Leveraging ethnographic insights and robust testing techniques, we also designed two concepts for future iteration:

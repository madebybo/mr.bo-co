  overview: "360 Video has been an emerging medium for more immersive content experiences. It is currently the most accessible form of virtual reality technology (smartphone accessible, enhanced experience with google cardboard devices), bolstered by the relatively low cost 360 video cameras and well-executed distribution platforms like Facebook and the New York Times. <br><br>This project aims to add Yieldmo's unique flavor to the experience and take the adoption even further: making it accessible virtually everywhere."

## the challenge

Most ad executions to date have focused on the basic technology, allowing a user to view multiple angles of a relatively simple 360 video. Yieldmo's opportunity may be to differentiate its offering by adding more of a narrative element or integrating 360 Video as a value-add into our other video experiences.

Like any brand new medium, simply showcasing the technology engages early adopters at first. The first film theaters would show a short clip of an oncoming train to entertain audiences. Eventually, viewers expect a narrative or other method of deeper connection. The same brands with the resources to produce 360 ads also aspire to an emotional connection with the user, cementing their place in the culture, etc. Yieldmo may be uniquely positioned to provide this given its human-centered approach to advertising.

## intro screens

How might we create an intro to 360 Video?

## usability testing

We conducted several rounds of usability testings to gauge users' interest and reaction to such a novel way of interacting with video content. Specifically, we tested the certain aspects of the design such as:

- users' physical behaviors and interactions
- full-screen mode
- sound vs. no sound

The example below outlines part of the result we gathered from the first round of Hallway Test, in which we tested with seven participants, each for approximately 15 minutes.

## future iteration

The first version of the product is welcomed with positive feedback and great performance lift across the board. Since Yieldmo's design infrastructure is built with "Components", it is only fitting to ask: How might we add new user experience on top or within 360 video content?

To answer that question, we combined this format with another popular Yieldmo video product: [Windowplay](/work/windowplay/). Below is a beta preview and what that looks like.

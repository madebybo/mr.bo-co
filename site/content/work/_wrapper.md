The Wrapper was born from advertiser’s desire to replicate a desktop takeover experience. Popular among entertainment brands, the Wrapper offers a top and bottom image as well as railing colors that allow your message to feel present throughout a reader’s experience without being disruptive or annoying. The Wrapper works on infinite scroll pages and is fully responsive to tablet sizes.

Often, the Wrapper is paired with an in-content format. This allows for messaging at the beginning, middle, and end of a web page and maximizes your impression. The Wrapper isn’t available on all publishers so be sure to consult with your Yieldmo Account Manager.

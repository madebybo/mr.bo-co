## the challenge

At Yieldmo, the design team have already established a static visual design language for formats. In order to bring the format products to the next level, it is necessary to expand that design infrastructure with a unique point of view for motion design.

The goal of this project is to develop this motion framework by studying animation in the context of format design, prototyping, testing assumptions and setting up the foundation for future growth.

## the framework

In order to develop Yieldmo Format Animation Framework, we need to understand animation in the context of format design.

- Clarifying the functionality and putting up design principles lays the foundation of the framework.
- Dissecting animation adn defining the syntax help us standardize the approach to motion design, as well as establish rules that should be followed.

## animation functionality

We propose that animation serve three main functionalities:

- **Intrigue**: to introduce ad unit or highlight component with elegant on-stage animation

- **Guide**: to communicate visual wayfinding and interaction status with transitional animation

- **respond**: to enhance the sense of manipulation with visual cues, as well as bring delight as a layer over functionality

## design principles

- **Respect** user through *unintrusive* and *lightweight* motions
  - Unintrusive: animation shouldn't strike user as a surprise, neither appear confusing or obnoxious.
  - Lightweight: animation should be effortless and subtle. It shouldn't drag performance nor abuse users' cognitive load.

- **Support** user through *seamless* and *resonating* transitions
  - Seamless: animation should be coherent across the entire experience. Aovid gratutious animation which might break the user flow.
  - Resonating: animation should take advantage of established UI patterns and paradigms. Choose familiarity over novelty.

- **Enchant** user through *rhythmic* and *tactile* responsies
  - Rhythmic: choreograph animation in a meaningful and elegant way. Every animation complements another to compose a harmonical appearance.
  - Tactile: use metaphorical visual language to enrich the digital experience. Celebrate character and vitality.


## dissection

Every complete atomic animation consists of three key parts:

- **Components:**: A component is the smallest entity that embodies a meaningful animation. When designing for animation, first clarify the component(s) involved.

- **Trigger**: A trigger dictates when an animation should happen. A trigger is a flexible mix of format environment, user behavior and interaction choreography. Specify the trigger before jumping in details, it will help prioritize and evaluate different design ideas.

- **Property:**: An animation is generated by changes of property. We lay out a set of properties, property relationships and functions on property changes. Apply rules in this section in order to keep consistency with Yieldmo motion visual language.

## effects

After laying the fundation by establishing a sound framework for our motion design language. We started exploring various visual effects that could be applied to the toolkit. While it's verbose to enumerate all effects we have created, it is necessary to list out a few:

<div>
  <img src="/work/spray/shine.gif">
  <h6 style="text-align: center;">Above: shine - to evoke attention, usually used to serve the "intrigue" function</h6>
</div>

<div>
  <img src="/work/spray/ripple.gif">
  <h6 style="text-align: center;">Above: ripple - to provide feedback, generally concludes a decisive action</h6>
</div>

<div>
  <img src="/work/spray/racecar.gif">
  <h6 style="text-align: center;">Above: racecar - to intrigue users, suitable for first sequense of motions</h6>
</div>

"We build tools and tools shape us" - The wisdom from Marshall Mcluhan still rings resoundingly true. As modern product design becomes more sophisticated and comprehensive, the intricate relationship between design and engineering often presents more frictions than facilitations. Like Mcluhan implied, we believe a highly efficient design team should incorporate technology to its fullest and the creation of such tools is pivotal to the success of the design practice.

Spray stands for **"<u>S</u>ystematically <u>P</u>rototyping <u>R</u>esponsive <u>A</u>nimations at <u>Y</u>ieldmo"**.

- Pre-defined triggers: 
  - Enter; Leave; Rest; Tap; iTouch; Long Tap; Tilt
- Pre-defined animation classes as building blocks
  - Bounce; Swing; Shake; Sketch; Shine; Fade; Glow; Highlight; Ripple


## case study

Applying our motion design framework, here is a detailed breakdown of how a very simple format–postcard, can be dissected and analyzed:

<div><img src="/work/spray/postcard-dissection.jpg"></div>

How we choreograph the experience from the begining (format enters the viewport) to the end (format leaves the viewport):

<div><img src="/work/spray/postcard-animation-flow.jpg"></div>

Here's an real-world example captured from one of Yieldmo's publisher page:

<div>
  <img style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 3px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.31);" src="/work/spray/spray-postcard.gif">
</div>


## outcome

In order to validate the framework, we need to prototype and utilize the A/B testing platform. The approach is to use Direct Response formats as a start, and bombine qualitative and quantitative testing methods.

The result:

- Improved user experience improvement for "Direct Response" formats.
- Significantly increased revenue increase owing to the implementation.
- Well-received thought pieces within the industry.

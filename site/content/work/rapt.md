  overview: The Yieldmo design team wanted to give business team a visual, mobile way to illustrate that their formats capture a lot of human interactions before the click, and show the potential to tie that data to insights and more elemental advertiser goals (like brand lift). The demo needs to be conducive to an advertiser client looking at it on their own phone during Cannes social events (Yieldmo Yacht, etc.), and needs to be reliable in low connection speed environments.

## the challenge

Digital publishing & advertising has a sophisticated process of gathering data and produce insights. Yieldmo is at a unique position since that amount of iteractions it's tracking is extremely rich and contextual. The purpose of this project is to create a interactive visualization tool that captures the behind-the-scene process.

## design sprint

The entire project is executed at a hyper-fast pace. We first run a week-long [design sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) inspired by Google Venture's agile design process. The concrete steps are as follows:

- Day 1: Identify opportunities and brainstorm ideas
- Day 2: Develop Low-fidelity prototypes for further ideation
- Day 3: Gather feedback and screen the winning idea
- Day 4: High fidelity prototype and design review
- Day 5: Develop functioning demo and iterate

The second week was esentially another design sprint with more focus and refined goals. We also addressed technical issues and troubleshoot potential bugs along the way.

## iconography

We decied to use icons to represent the variety of interactions that Yieldmo's formats are tracking. There are three keys to iconography pertaining to this project.

- They need to be consistent with the Yieldmo brand and theme of the event.
- They need to be distinct and diverse enough to be identified on mobile devices.
- They should not feel foreign so users can easier understand what is meaning behind each icon.

These icons can be used in a variety of ways to create delightful messages.

## user interface

The user interface of the RAPT™ demo has three parts:

**The starting screen** is a sequence of messages to inform the product and some teasers about the capability of the demo.

**The main screen** is where all the interactivities happen. When user interact with an ad just like they normally would, a small tray will appear at the bottom of the screen. As can be seen from the image below, this tiny UI consists of 4 parts:

- Summary CTA: tap on this button will take users to the insights summary screen.
- Icons Tray: this is a snapshot of all interactions that have happened while user interacts with the ad.
- Display Panel: notifies user the exact name of the interaction at the moment, this helps clarification.
- Timer: keeps track of how long user has been interacting with the ad.

**The summary screen** is also the last screen. It recaps the entire session and estimates "Ad Recall Probability", a Yieldmo-proprietary metric that is used to determine how likely one user is to recall the product in the future.

## interaction

When it comes to interaction design, we decided to use a fictional "tray" to carry out the interactions.

Here is a closed look at how icons are "popped" onto the tray.

<div><img style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 3px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.31);" src="/work/rapt/interaction-tray.gif"></div>

Here is how that can be amplified in real-world context

## iteration

Although there were only two weeks to complete the project. The design team were able to go through at least three major iterations and various UX tweaks. Here is an evolution of the "Icons Tray" part of the main screen throughout the course of the project:

When a new interaction takes place:

## outcome

Since it's first appearance, the RAPT™ demo has been highly successful and effectively in illustrating Yieldmo's product strategy and commitment to Data and Design. It is even cited internally by some as **"the most impactful sales tool in our company history"**.
